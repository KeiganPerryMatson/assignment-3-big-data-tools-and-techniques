Create a python application that:

- Reads JSON from API
- Inserts into RedisJSON
- Does some processing (3 outputs) such as (matplotlib charts, aggregation, search, etc)
    
The python application should be:

- Using python classes (not plain scripting as shown in lecture notes)
- Should contain necessary docstring
- Should be aligned properly
- Code should be pushed to GitHUB public repo (not uploaded)

Submit the following:

- GitHUB URL
- Capture input / output as screenshots (should be clearly visible), add it to Google Doc, and share the URL

Follow the URL guidelines (clickable, shared, and no email notification)

Just a friendly heads-up: for EACH little slip-up, like python classes, missing docstrings, uploading manually to GitHUB, messy code alignment, URL guidelines, you'll lose 5 points.
